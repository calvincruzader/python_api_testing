<h2> Hello! </h2>

<h4>This is an exercise for building and testing a basic python API. </h4>

`test/test_my_restful_api.py` has the unit tests for the API

`devl/my_restful_api.py` has the actual functionality of API, which right now is GET/POST/PUT/DELETE

Instructions: 
* To initialize db, run `python devl/my_db_initialize.py`
* Then to run the app, run `python devl/my_restful_api.py`
* Then to run the tests, run `pytest test/test_my_restful_api.py`

If dependencies are missing, try running `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
